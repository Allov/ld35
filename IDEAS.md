## Shapeshift

About shapeshifting, changing form.

> In mythology, folklore and speculative fiction, shapeshifting, or metamorphosis is the ability of an entity to physically transform into another being or form. This is usually achieved through an inherent faculty of a mythological creature, divine intervention, or the use of magic spells or talismans.

### Shapeshifting general

* Tetris?
* Grid based game where you create shapes by matching colors / shapes.
* 

### Shapeshifting to a music beat

* Guitar hero / Super hexagon mashup
  * Beat brings shapes (squares, circles, triangles, hexagon, etc.) and you have to match them.
  * Absorbs shapes as they come in large group, the more you aborb, more points?
  * Lose points when you can match?
  * Speed/Difficulty of the game increase as the song BPM is faster (throw more shapes?)
  * Some sort of delay between waves of shapes so the player has time to shift.
  * Rail of shapes, there are 3-6 shape rail where the player has to match shape as they come down, otherwise they get destroyed (lose points?).
  * How to shapeshift?
    * Create shapes with gesture?
    * One-click swap?
    * Bank of shapes, you click the one you want?
* Ikaruga style of gameplay, without the shooting part
  * Absorb shaped projectiles while matching the shape?
* Spectrum based gameplay.
  * Integrate shapes into the sound spectrum somehow
